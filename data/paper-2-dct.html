            <tr><th><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract">dct:abstract</a></th><td>The PROV data model is becoming accepted as a flexible and robust tool for formalizing information relating to the production of documents and datasets. Provenance stores based on the PROV-O implementation are appearing in support of scientific data workflows. However, the scope of PROV does not have to be limited to digital or information assets. For example, specimens typically undergo complex preparation sequences prior to actual observations and measurements, and it is important to record this to ensure reproducibility and to enable assessment of the reliability of data produced. PROV provides a flexible solution, allowing a comprehensive trace of predecessor entities and transformations at any level of detail. In this paper we demonstrate the use of PROV for describing specimens managed for scientific observations. Two examples are considered: a geological sample which undergoes a typical preparation process for measurements of the concentration of a particular chemical substance, and the collection, taxonomic classification and eventual publication of an insect specimen. We briefly compare PROV with related work.</td></tr>
